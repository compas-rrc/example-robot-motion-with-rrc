This example demonstrates a movement for an ABB robot using the COMPAS RRC 
python API from Grasshopper.

To run the example:

* Run ``python -m compas_rhino.install`` to install compas packages to Rhino and 
  Grasshopper. See `COMPAS - Rhino (Windows and Mac) <https://compas.dev/compas/latest/gettingstarted/rhino.html>`_
  for more details.
* Start the robot where the RRC driver is installed.
* Start ROS driver using Docker (see example ``docker-compose.yml`` below).
* Open `grasshopper-script.ghx <./grasshopper-script.ghx>`_ in Grasshopper.

For more details, check the `COMPAS RRC Start <https://github.com/compas-rrc/compas_rrc_start>`_ repository.
